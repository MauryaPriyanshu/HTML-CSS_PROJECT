    <h1> Java Tutorial </h1>

        <p>Our core Java programming tutorial is designed for students and working professionals. 
            Java is an object-oriented, class-based, concurrent, secured and general-purpose computer-programming language.
            It is a widely used robust technology.</p>
            <h2>What is Java?</h2>
            <p> Java is a programming language and a plateform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure programming language.
                <br>
                Java was developed by <i>Sun Microsystems</i>(which is now the subsidiary of oracle) in the year 1995. <i> James Gosling</i> 
                is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak.Since Oak was already a registered company, so James Gosling 
                and his term changed the name from Oak to java. </p>
                
                <h3>Platefrom:</h3>
                <p> Any hardware or software environment in which a program runs, is known as a platform. Since Java has a runtime environment
                     (JRE) and API, it is called a platform.
                </p>
                <h2>Java Example</h2>
                <p>Let's have a quick look at Java programming example. A detailed description of Hello Java example is available in next page.</p>
                <p>class Simple{</p>  
                    <p>public static void main(String args[]){</p>  
                        <p>System.out.println("Hello Java");</p>  
                        <p>}</p>  
                }  </p>
